# ga_legis_api_examples
Examples of how to access the [Georgia Legislature's](http://www.legis.ga.gov/en-US/default.aspx) API with Python 3.7 & the [Zeep module](https://python-zeep.readthedocs.io/en/master/).

The Georgia Legislature's API has info back to 2001 on House & Senate members, votes, schedules, committees and more.

I don't know if they have any documentation of their API. I do know it's something called a SOAP API, which is a term I've only seen in Georgia General Assembly context. Not that state government has *a lot* of APIs.

Anyway, if you only need data from 2017 forward, you may prefer [OpenStates.org's API](http://www.openstates.org). 

Hope it's helpful,
