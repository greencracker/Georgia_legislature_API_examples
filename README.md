Examples of how to access the Georgia Legislature's API with Python.

The Georgia Legislature's API has info back to 2001 on House & Senate members, votes, schedules, committees and more.

I don't know if they have any documentation of their API.

So here are some examples of how to access the API with Python 3.7.

These examples will go back to 2001.

But if you only need data from 2017 forward, you may like [OpenStates.org's API](http://www.openstates.org). 

Hope it's helpful,
