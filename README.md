# ga_legis_api_examples
Examples of how to access the [Georgia Legislature's](http://www.legis.ga.gov/en-US/default.aspx) API with Python 3.7 & the [Zeep module](https://python-zeep.readthedocs.io/en/master/).

The Georgia Legislature's API has info back to 2001 on House & Senate members, votes, schedules, committees and more.

I don't know if they have any documentation of their API.

So here are some examples.

This data goes back to 2001.

But if you only need data from 2017 forward, you may like [OpenStates.org's API](http://www.openstates.org). 

Hope it's helpful,
